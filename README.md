***Testimonials***  
“Thank you for your strong support in helping me to move from my home of 56 years. I can't believe how much stuff I had accumulated over time. Your team was great and even found my missing $2600 cash! You were always positive and in control of the task at hand, when I was not! I'll miss seeing you and would give Island Transitions a 10 out of 10 rating!" - With gratitude, Rhonnie Lewis, Oceanside, NY
